# Lightweight Lua
A library of several useful functions, also 3D rendering.  Aims to make lua scripting less of a pain.

### Lightweight 3D
Also includes a simplistic 3d rendering library, lw3.  This is what Omen in FFFTL uses.

### Doubly Linked List
A basic doubly linked list implementation.

### XML Generation (new)
Lua scripts for creating the xml required for animations and lab upgrades.  Leave suggestions if you think I should add something here.
