# Lightweight Lua
A library of several useful functions, also 3D rendering.  Aims to make lua scripting less of a pain.

### Lightweight 3D
A simplistic 3d rendering library, lw3.  This is what Omen in FFFTL uses.

### UI Library
Do all sorts of things with a whole bunch of visual elements.  Used in Grimdark Expy.

### Status Effects Library
Apply statuses to crew, such as bleed, corruption, and confusion. Used in Grimdark Expy.

### Keybinds
Create your own key combinations; and longer form commands in the minibuffer

### XML Generation
Lua scripts for creating the xml required for animations and lab upgrades.  Leave suggestions if you think I should add something here.

### Self-Indexing List
For when you want members to implicitly know their index.

### Doubly Linked List
A basic doubly linked list implementation.

### Crew Change Observers
Register to know when your ship's crew changes

### Teleport Status Observers
Register to know if any crew is teleporting
