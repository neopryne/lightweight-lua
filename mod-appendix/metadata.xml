A number of lua utilities.  
	Lightweight lua (lwl) for a number of utility functions
	Lightweight 3d (lw3) for barebones 3d rendering
	LWUI, a decently featured UI library
	Crew Effects that you can apply to crew as you see fit
		A help bar for information you want the player to have but not be too disruptive
	Some data structures (currently a doubly linked list implementation).


Requirements:
	VertexUtils
	Brightness Particles 1.4+
